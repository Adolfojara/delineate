DELINEATE is a package that implements the DELINEATE approach to species delimitation (Sukumaran, Holder, and Knowles, 2020). This approach integrates an explicit model of speciation into the multipopulation coalescent (also known as the "censored" or "multispecies" coalescent) model, to organize a set of population lineages sampled from one or more species into mutually-exclusive and jointly-comprehensive subsets, where each subset of population lineages represents a distinct species.

DELINEATE requires |Python|_ 3.7 or greater to run.
Package and dependency management is greatly simplified if |pip|_ is installed as well.
