# Introduction

DELINEATE is an approach to species delimitation that incorporates an extended model of speciation to discriminate between population isolation and speciation boundaries in genomic structure. Given a tree of population lineages inferred under the classical "censored coalescent" (Rannala and Yang, 2003; Yang and Rannala 2010), now more commonly known as the "multipecies coalescent" or MSC (Degnan and Rosenberg, 2009), this package will calculate the probabilities of different organizations of the population lineages into species under the Protracted Birth Death model of (Etienne et al, 2012)
